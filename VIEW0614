Where will the coin market go ?

I think here is a temporary floor.
There will be some retracement and this will be a retracement for the downside.
Maybe most altcoins will go -95% per high contrast.
as same as LUNA and TERA, all DEFI are PONZI scams.

If so, what strategy should we devise?
I think there is a possibility of some degree of inflection in this position. But after all, isn't the destination 20k?
Normalization ends up being 20k or much lower, which is the equivalent of 9.7k for nasdaq.
Normalization will take place only when that point is reached.
If markets will be stabilized, New meta will arrive.
I expect next meta will be WEB3.

but i also think about The end of the coin markets... likes bankruptcy of the binance,coinbase ... or stables like Tether
This is a risk that must be considered.

How will you guys expect?
